                            a framework that more readily supports asynchronous tasks and web sockets. Communication
                            with utility company APIs can result in long blocking requests. This
                            is currently mitigated by enabling threading in uWSGI and starting a
                            custom event loop in the Flask app that handles long requests to utility
                            APIs.

                            Add "dupe detection" to the C portion of the code. For audio files this would

                <h3>Bio</h3>
                <p>
                    J.P. Hutchins grew up on a small farm in Southern Oregon where he had the opportunity to explore the
                    outdoors identifying insects, reptiles, and anything that moved, really, even nematomorphs. He also
                    had
                    the chance to drive a radio flyer off of a steep driveway into a blackberry bramble and to eat lots
                    of
                    those berries. From a young age, J.P. was exploring electronics and making DOS boot disks so that
                    he could run 3D games on his parent's 486. His affinity for mathematics, calculus and engineering
                    lead
                    to a love of classical music and jazz. By age 14 he was channeling this creativity into grandiose
                    (*angsty) orchestral scores. * Imagine what a Mahler-obsessed teenager would write
                    in between Final Fantasy VII / high fantasy / sci-fi sessions.

                <p>
                    The need to invent changes over time and J.P.'s creative spirit is refocused to develop elegant
                    software, hardware
                    and systems.
                </p>
                <h3>Musician</h3>
                <p>
                    As an instrumentalist, J.P. began horn & trumpet in elementary school, piano in the 7th grade and
                    organ
                    in 10th grade. He was fortunate to study theory and composition with Steve McManus, piano & organ
                    with
                    Helen Strahl and to receive an AGO scholarship to study organ with Dr. Margaret Evans. As a trumpet
                    player, J.P. studied with Bruce Dresser and is
                    dedicated to the classical techniques of Arnold Schlossberg, James Stamp and Roy Poper, professer of
                    trumpet at Oberlin. These techniques encourage consistency of tone & intonation, articulation, and
                    efficiency through wide ranges and demanding orchestral passages. J.P. performed as principal
                    trumpet in
                    the YSSO, led by Dr. Cynthia Hutton, for many memorable performances.
                </p>
                <h3>Composer</h3>
                <p>
                    Studying composition at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music from 2004-2008, J.P. developed an interest
                    in
                    American Experimentalism and electronic/computer music with the help of professors Randy Coleman &
                    Ross Feller.
                    Much of his music features systems based on chance procedures or more rigid mathematical functions
                    while a primary
                    goal is to a achieve a balance between consonant sonorities and romantically influenced atonal
                    passages.
                    Maintaining an interest in counterpoint, evolving motives, and the full palette of each instrument
                    results in a kind of interplay between a modern and traditional aesthetic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That said, J.P. really likes folk music, funk, hip-hop, EDM, and most any music that challenges the
                    listener to either get down, look within, or get up and make the world a better place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In his spare time, J.P. tinkers with electronics, assorted DIY projects, and the development of an
                    improvisational computer music interface that feeds back analog and digital material in a sort of
                    real-time compositional computer game. Of funk.
