                        The water tuned glassophone is an original mallet instrument constructed of lenths
                        of glass tubing closed at one end. Unlike traditional mallet instruments, such as
                        the marimba, each pitch can be tuned by varying the amount of water in the tube.
                        This series of improvisations gives an idea of the sound using a traditional equal
                        temperment tuning with the addition of two quarter tone tubes. The dynamic range of
                        the instrument is impressive though the recordings are dynamically compressed for
                        easier listening. Played softly, the instrument produces a clean sustained tone;
                        played more aggressively you will hear a sharp &quot;metallic&quot; attack to each
                        tone.

                        The glass tubes were cut to approximate lengths based on experimentation and then tuned
                        by filling them with water. In order for the tube to sound it must be as free from
                        constraint as possible allowing it to vibrate.

                    <h3>About Crumpled Paper and J.P. Hutchins</h3>
                    <p>
                        Crumpled Paper is my website for personal and open source projects. The name originates
                        from the notion that work is built on a foundation of "crumpled paper". Glancing
                        around my desk this conclusion is obvious and there you will find projects in various
                        stages: flat, wrinkled, and crumpled.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Technology</h4>
                    <p>
                        I am a software and hardware engineer that likes using C, Python and JavaScript. My favorite
                        language is the one I've been using in the past week. Lately I am enjoying learning about
                        functional programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of my projects run on my local set of servers using Raspberry Pi, ARM, x86, Ubuntu, KVM,
                        Nginx,
                        uWSGI, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker. I maintain a multi LAN multi VLAN network to
                        support all of these services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For MCU I like developing on ESP8266 and ESP32 because they are so well integrated into
                        the Arduino ecosystem. Lately I have moved onto the STM32 family for work that requires DSP or
                        more accurate ADC.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Goals</h4>
                    <p>
                        My primary goal is to work on software and hardware that helps to address the climate change
                        crisis. That has lead me to the smart home automation (IoT) industry I where worked on
                        everything
                        from architectural drawings to construction, from
                        programming to support for three years at <a href="https://jlintegrated.com/" target="_blank">
                            JL Integrated</a>. Additionally I contribute to the Denon and Transmission integrations of
                        <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" target="_blank">
                            Home Assistant</a>, the leading open-source smart home platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another longterm goal is to setup a woodshop and minimal anechoic chamber so that I can commence
                        serious development of modern loud speaker solutions for the smart home.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Musician</h3>
                    <p>
                        As an instrumentalist, J.P. began horn & trumpet in elementary school, piano in the 7th grade
                        and
                        organ
                        in 10th grade. He was fortunate to study theory and composition with Steve McManus, piano &
                        organ
                        with
                        Helen Strahl and to receive an AGO scholarship to study organ with Dr. Margaret Evans. As a
                        trumpet
                        player, J.P. studied with Bruce Dresser and is
                        dedicated to the classical techniques of Arnold Schlossberg, James Stamp and Roy Poper,
                        professer of
                        trumpet at Oberlin. These techniques encourage consistency of tone & intonation, articulation,
                        and
                        efficiency through wide ranges and demanding orchestral passages. J.P. performed as principal
                        trumpet in
                        the YSSO, led by Dr. Cynthia Hutton, for many memorable performances.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Composer</h3>
                    <p>
                        Studying composition at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music from 2004-2008, J.P. developed an
                        interest
                        in
                        American Experimentalism and electronic/computer music with the guidance of professors Randy
                        Coleman
                        &
                        Ross Feller.
                        Much of his music features systems based on chance procedures or more rigid mathematical
                        functions
                        while a primary
                        goal is to a achieve a balance between consonant sonorities and romantically influenced atonal
                        passages.
                        Maintaining an interest in counterpoint, evolving motives, and the full palette of each
                        instrument
                        results in a kind of interplay between a modern and traditional aesthetic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That said, J.P. really likes folk music, funk, hip-hop, EDM, and most any music that challenges
                        the
                        listener to either get down, look within, or get up and make the world a better place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In his spare time J.P. tinkers with the development of an
                        improvisational computer music interface that feeds back analog and digital material in a sort
                        of
                        real-time compositional computer game. Of funk.
