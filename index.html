            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>
                J.P. Hutchins grew up on a small farm in Southern Oregon where he had the opportunity to explore the
                outdoors identifying insects, reptiles, and anything that moved, really, even nematomorphs. He also had
                the chance to drive a radio flyer off of a steep driveway into a blackberry bramble and to eat lots of
                those berries. From a young age, J.P. was exploring electronics and making DOS boot disks so that
                he could run 3D games on his parent's 486. His affinity for mathematics, calculus and engineering lead
                to a love of classical music and jazz.  By age 14 he was channeling this creativity into grandiose
                (*angsty) orchestral scores.  * Imagine what a Mahler-obsessed teenager would write
                in between Final Fantasy VII / high fantasy / sci-fi sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The need to invent changes over time and J.P.'s creative spirit is refocused to develop elegant software, hardware
                and systems.
            </p>
            <h3>Musician</h3>
            <p>
                As an instrumentalist, J.P. began horn & trumpet in elementary school, piano in the 7th grade and organ
                in 10th grade. He was fortunate to study theory and composition with Steve McManus, piano & organ with
                Helen Strahl and to receive an AGO scholarship to study organ with Dr. Margaret Evans. As a trumpet player, J.P. studied with Bruce Dresser and is
                dedicated to the classical techniques of Arnold Schlossberg, James Stamp and Roy Poper, professer of
                trumpet at Oberlin. These techniques encourage consistency of tone & intonation, articulation, and
                efficiency through wide ranges and demanding orchestral passages. J.P. performed as principal trumpet in
                the YSSO, led by Dr. Cynthia Hutton, for many memorable performances.
            </p>
            <h3>Composer</h3>
            <p>
                Studying composition at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music from 2004-2008, J.P. developed an interest in
                American Experimentalism and electronic/computer music with the help of professors Randy Coleman & Ross Feller.
                Much of his music features systems based on chance procedures or more rigid mathematical functions while a primary
                goal is to a achieve a balance between consonant sonorities and romantically influenced atonal passages.
                Maintaining an interest in counterpoint, evolving motives, and the full palette of each instrument
                results in a kind of interplay between a modern and traditional aesthetic.
            </p>
            <p>
                That said, J.P. really likes folk music, funk, hip-hop, EDM, and most any music that challenges the
                listener to either get down, look within, or get up and make the world a better place.
            </p>
            <p>
                In his spare time, J.P. tinkers with electronics, assorted DIY projects, and the development of an
                improvisational computer music interface that feeds back analog and digital material in a sort of
                real-time compositional computer game. Of funk.
